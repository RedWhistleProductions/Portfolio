This version of my portfolio uses CSS to create modals.

The advantages:
	Modals work even if JavaScript is disabled
	The code is cleaner and runs faster on a larger site do to not using Javascript
	
The disadvantages:
	The CSS uses pointer-events which is not CSS3 compliant, but acording to Mozilla will be
	included in CSS4. It is currently supported by all major browsers, but may not be supported
	if the browser is an older version.
